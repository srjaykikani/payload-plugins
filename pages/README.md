# JHB Software - Payload Pages Plugin

[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/%40jhb.software%2Fpayload-pages-plugin)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jhb.software/payload-pages-plugin)

The Payload Pages plugin simplifies website building by adding essential fields to your collections. These fields enable hierarchical page structures and dynamic URL management.

## Setup

First, add the plugin to your payload config as follows:

```ts
plugins: [payloadPagesPlugin({})]
```

Next, create a page collections using the `PageCollectionConfig` type. This type extends Payload's `CollectionConfig` type with a `page` field that contains configurations for the page collection. The `page` field must be specified as follows:

- `parent.collection`: The slug of the collection that will be used as the parent of the current collection.
- `parent.name`: The name of the field on the parent collection that will be used to relate to the current collection.
- `isRootCollection`: Whether the collection is the root collection (collection which contains the root page). If true, the parent field is optional. Defaults to `false`.
- `parent.sharedDocument` (optional, defaults to `false`): If true, the parent document will be shared between all documents in the collection.
- `breadcrumbs.labelField` (optional, defaults to `admin.useAsTitle`): The name of the field that will be used to label the document in the breadcrumb.
- `slug.fallbackField` (optional, defaults to `title`): The name of the field that will be used as the fallback for the slug.

Here is an example of the page collection config of the root collection:

```ts
import { PageCollectionConfig } from '@jhb.software/payload-pages-plugin'

const Pages: PageCollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'pages',
  admin: {
    useAsTitle: 'title',
  },
  page: {
    parent: {
      collection: 'pages',
      name: 'parent',
    },
    isRootCollection: true,
  },
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'title',
      type: 'text',
      required: true,
    },
    // other fields
  ],
}
```

Then additional collections can be created. Documents in these collections will be nested under documents in the root collection.

```ts
import { PageCollectionConfig } from '@jhb.software/payload-pages-plugin'

const Posts: PageCollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'posts',
  page: {
    parent: {
      collection: 'pages',
      name: 'parent',
      sharedDocument: true,
    },
  },
  fields: [
    // your fields
  ],
}
```

The plugin also includes a `RedirectsCollectionConfig` type that can be used to create a redirects collection. This type extends Payload's `CollectionConfig` type with a `redirects` field that contains configurations for the redirects collection.

```ts
import { RedirectsCollectionConfig } from '@jhb.software/payload-pages-plugin'

const Redirects: RedirectsCollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'redirects',
  admin: {
    defaultColumns: ['sourcePath', 'destinationPath', 'permanent', 'createdAt'],
    listSearchableFields: ['sourcePath', 'destinationPath'],
  },
  redirects: {},
  fields: [
    // the fields are added by the plugin automatically
  ],
}
```

In order for the official payload SEO plugin to use the generated URL, you need to pass the `getPageUrl` function provided by this plugin to the `generateURL` field in the `seo` plugin config inside your payload config. 
If your collections are localized, you also need to pass the `alternatePathsField` field to the `fields` array.

```ts
import { alternatePathsField, getPageUrl } from '@jhb.software/payload-pages-plugin'

export default buildConfig({
  // ...
  plugins: [
    seoPlugin({
      generateURL: ({ doc }) => getPageUrl({ path: doc.path })!,
      fields: ({ defaultFields }) => [...defaultFields, alternatePathsField()],
    }),
  ],
})
```

### Multi-tenant support

> ⚠️ **Warning**: The multi-tenant support is currently experimental and may change in the future.

The plugin supports multi-tenant setups via the official [Multi-tenant plugin](https://payloadcms.com/docs/plugins/multi-tenant).

By default the plugin adds a unique constraint to the slug field of all page collections. In a multi-tenant setup you can disable this constraint by setting the `unique` field to `false` in the page collection config. To ensure uniqueness for a tenant to now have pages with multiple slugs, you can create a compound unique index.

Example:    

```ts
export const Pages: PageCollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'pages',
  page: {
    slug: {
      // Disable the slug uniqueness because of the multi-tenant setup (see indexes below)
      unique: false,
    },
  },
  indexes: [
    {
      fields: ['slug', 'tenant'],
      unique: true,
    },
  ],
  fields: [ /* your fields */],
} 
```

Some features (e.g. the parent and isRootPage fields) internally fetch documents from the database. To ensure only documents from the current tenant are fetched, you need to pass the `baseFilter` function to the plugin config. It receives the current request object and should return a `Where` object which will be added to the query.
For the validation of the redirects, you need to pass the `redirectValidationFilter` function to the plugin config. It receives the current request object and the document object and should return a `Where` object which will be added to the query.

Example:

```ts
import { payloadPagesPlugin } from '@jhb.software/payload-pages-plugin'
import { getTenantFromCookie } from '@payloadcms/plugin-multi-tenant/utilities'

export default buildConfig({
  // ...
  plugins: [
    payloadPagesPlugin({
      baseFilter: ({ req }) => {
        const tenant = getTenantFromCookie(req.headers, req.payload.db.defaultIDType)

        return { tenant: { equals: tenant } }
      },
      redirectValidationFilter: ({ doc }) => {
        return { tenant: { equals: doc.tenant } }
      },
    }),
  ],
})
```

### Parent Deletion Prevention

The plugin automatically prevents the deletion of parent documents that are referenced by child documents, protecting your data integrity and preventing orphaned references. This feature is enabled by default but can be disabled if needed.

#### Automatic Protection for MongoDB, SQLite, and PostgreSQL

When using MongoDB, SQLite, or PostgreSQL as your database adapter, the plugin includes a `beforeDelete` hook that:

- **Prevents deletion** of any document that serves as a parent to other documents
- **Checks all configured page collections** for references to the document being deleted
- **Supports multi-tenant environments** by respecting your `baseFilter` configuration
- **Provides clear error messages** indicating which child documents are preventing the deletion

This custom logic is necessary because these database adapters don't enforce foreign key constraints at the database level for Payload relationship fields.

#### Other Database Adapters

For other database adapters that may enforce referential integrity natively, the plugin's custom deletion prevention logic is automatically bypassed.

#### Error Messages

When attempting to delete a referenced parent document in MongoDB, SQLite, or PostgreSQL, you'll see a descriptive error message:

```
Cannot delete document: 3 child document(s) reference this document as their parent in collection 'pages'
```

#### Disabling Parent Deletion Prevention

If you need to allow deletion of parent documents regardless of child references, you can disable this protection:

```ts
plugins: [
  payloadPagesPlugin({
    preventParentDeletion: false
  })
]
```

#### Resolving Deletion Conflicts

To delete a parent document that has child references, you have two options:

1. **Reassign child documents**: Update the child documents to reference a different parent
2. **Remove child documents**: Delete the child documents first, then delete the parent

Example of reassigning a child document:

```ts
// Update child document to reference a different parent
await payload.update({
  collection: 'pages',
  id: childDocumentId,
  data: {
    parent: newParentId, // or null to make it a root document
  },
})

// Now the original parent can be safely deleted
await payload.delete({
  collection: 'pages',
  id: originalParentId,
})
```

### Environment variables

The following environment variables are required:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FRONTEND_URL`

## About this plugin

This plugin streamlines website development with Payload CMS by providing enhanced document nesting capabilities. While the official [Nested Docs plugin](https://payloadcms.com/docs/plugins/nested-docs) only supports nesting within a single collection, this plugin enables nesting documents across multiple collections. Another major difference is that this plugin uses virtual fields for the paths and breadcrumbs, ensuring these computed values stay automatically synchronized with your content structure.

## Roadmap

> ⚠️ **Warning**: This plugin is actively evolving and may undergo significant changes. While it is functional, please thoroughly test before using in production environments.
