## Features

- translate content in the Payload Admin UI between locales
- supports any translation service using a resolver pattern (e.g. OpenAI, DeepL, etc.)
- comes with a ready-to-use OpenAI resolver out of the box
- seamless integration with Payload's localization system
- review and edit translations before saving or publishing

## Setup

Install the plugin and add it to your Payload config:

```ts
import {
  payloadContentTranslatorPlugin,
  openAIResolver,
} from '@jhb.software/payload-content-translator-plugin'

export default buildConfig({
  // Enable localization
  localization: {
    defaultLocale: 'en' /* example */,
    locales: ['en', 'de'] /* example */,
  },
  plugins: [
    payloadContentTranslatorPlugin({
      collections: ['pages', 'posts'],
      globals: ['settings'],
      /* openAI or any other resolver */
      resolver: openAIResolver({
        apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
        model: 'gpt-4o-mini',
      }),
    }),
  ],
})
```

## Configuration

### Plugin Options

| Option        | Type                | Required | Description                           |
| ------------- | ------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `collections` | `CollectionSlug[]`  | Yes      | Collections to enable translation for |
| `globals`     | `GlobalSlug[]`      | Yes      | Globals to enable translation for     |
| `resolver`    | `TranslateResolver` | Yes      | Translation resolver to use           |
| `enabled`     | `boolean`           | No       | Whether to enable the plugin.         |

### Resolvers

This plugin is designed to work seamlessly with various translation services by accepting a customizable translation resolver as a configuration option.

An OpenAI resolver is provided out of the box, but you can use any translation provider by creating your own resolver and specifying it in the plugin configuration.

#### OpenAI Resolver

```ts
import { openAIResolver } from '@jhb.software/payload-content-translator-plugin'

openAIResolver({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  model: 'gpt-4o-mini', // or 'gpt-4', 'gpt-3.5-turbo', etc.
})
```

## Custom Resolver

You can create your own resolver by implementing the `TranslateResolver` interface.

```ts
import type { TranslateResolver } from '@jhb.software/payload-content-translator-plugin'

export const customResolver = (): TranslateResolver => ({
  key: 'custom',
  resolve: ({ localeTo, texts }) => {
    const translatedTexts = texts.map((text) => {
      /* your custom translation logic here */
      return text
    })

    return { success: true, translatedTexts }
  },
})
```
